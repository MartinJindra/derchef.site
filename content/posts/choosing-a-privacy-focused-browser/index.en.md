What is the probability that this page will be displayed on Google Chrome?
According to a [market analysis](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share) it is about 65%.
If the answer is yes, then it does beg the question:

> Why is Google Chrome so widely used?

This question is difficult to answer, because we don't know the reasons of each person's decisions.
Nevertheless, one can make a few guesses.

**Google recommends their browser.**

[google.com](https://www.google.com) is one of the most visited websites on the Internet and since their search engine is so popular, they may also recommend their browser directly.
Many who use Google services with Firefox or Safari have often noticed Google recommending their browser to provide a \"better experience\".

**Chrome on any Android**

Another point where Google shows its reach is that they develop the most successful mobile operating system.
Android now has over [three billion active devices](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440813/android-devices-active-number-smartphones-google-2021) and all of them have Google Chrome installed.
Most people usually stick with what's pre-installed unless it's as incredibly bad as Internet Explorer.

**So why this article?**

So let's get to the real point of this text.
Should you use Google Chrome?
Yes or No.
And if No what instead?
The answer is really subjective.
Everyone likes something different and may not have the same values as other lizard people (:wink:).

Personally, I value privacy and security.
And Chrome is quite ok with security.
As I mentioned before it's no Internet Explorer.
It is usable.
But the privacy is not there.
It's no secret by now that Chrome collects data and uses it for advertising.
That's why many want to switch.

### Alternatives

**Brave**

Some who will read this article will surely think that only Firefox is recommended, but that is not true.
Many people won't switch from a Chromium base.
Maybe that's because there is an extension that doesn't exist anywhere else or they like the dev tools.
In that case, Brave is a good recommendation.
It is an open-source browser that is also based on Chromium and unlike Chrome, it offers a built-in ad blocker and blocks trackers, including those from Google.

**Ungoogled Chromium**

A relatively unknown option is Ungoogled Chromium.
It is as the name suggests Chromium without Google.
Downloads are available for all major systems except smartphones.
It is perfect if a minimalist experience is desired.

**Firefox**

Unfortunately, if you want to completely abandon Chromium, there is only one other choice, Firefox.
A good alternative if you want a common browser that doesn't scream Google.

This is only a small overview, but you can still look around for more alternatives.
