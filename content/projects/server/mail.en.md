## Selfhosted e-mail server

Having your own email server may seem like a strange idea to many people. Why should I run my own server, which sends and receives my e-mails.

> Isn't that hard?

By itself. Yes! Every project has its hurdles, but you don't have to reinvent the wheel. You can also take help from other projects. There are a few useful ones that make it easy.

### Mailinabox

One is [Mailinabox](https://mailinabox.email). This incredible project makes it incredibly easy to create your own email server. The only conditions it has are

- [x] an Ubuntu 18.04 server,
- [x] a public IPv4 address that is not on a blacklist,
- [x] a domain pointing to the IP address.

Complete instructions can be found [here](https://mailinabox.email/guide.html).
