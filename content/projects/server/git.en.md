## What does the server use

My private git server uses

+ Gitea,
+ Postresql and
+ Nginx.

## Why use Gitea?

Some people may wonder why not just use Github or Gitlab. Why host your own git server that uses extra power and costs money? Honestly I just wanted to try if it is possible. To create a place where I can host software that I write and need. Of course most people should use these services.
