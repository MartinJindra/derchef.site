My name is _Martin Jindra_.
I am a programmer and system administrator.
I have various skills in computer science.
My skills go from programming to providing various services.

I have been fascinated with software for several years and my skills have only grown since then. My strengths include working in a team, finding solutions to problems quickly, and working with new software.
Most of my programs are on my [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/MartinJindra).
